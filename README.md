Author: Carlos Adrian Alarcon

The purpose of this project is to predict wheter the salary would be higher or lower of the 75th percentile based on the job description.

For this project, I have used text analytics tecniques as tokenization, lemmatization, vectorization, among others. The approach was preprocessing data and using a Naive Bayes model.
